      <description>Data Science in Education Using R I&amp;rsquo;m super excited to share that I will be writing a book, Data Science in Education Using R. The book will be published by Routledge sometime in mid-to-late 2020, and, importantly to us, Routledge agreed to let us keep the copyright for a web-version of the book, meaning that we will publish the entire contents of the book in an open and freely-available format (along with the print and e-book versions, which will be available for sale).</description>

      <description>data-science-ish I presented yesterday on Data Science-Ish: The Use of Mixed Effects Models for Analyzing Complex Data at the KnoxData group.
Abstract Here is an abstract for the talk:
 Mixed effects (or multilevel) models are extensions of linear models (regressions) that are commonly used in experimental research and policy and evaluation contexts, but are less widely-used by data scientists. In this talk, I aim to introduce mixed effects model as a data science-ish statistical method that can be useful and is easy to estimate and interpret.</description>

      <description>This past week, I presented a workshop, Won’t you be my neighboR? An introduction to R for data science in education. for Educational Psychology and Educational Technology PhD students (and a few others) with Emily Bovee.
Here is the description:
 R is a freely-available, cross-platform, open-source programming language and statistical software environment that is well-suited to data analysis and data science, but, can have an high barrier to entry. This workshop provides an introduction to R in education, with a focus on developing a foundation in capabilities (and confidence!</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of productive discussion around open education research (or science).
Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed some examples of what I think are good open education research.
Though I think of these as good examples and models for the rest of us to follow, I think some of them are not always appreciated as such. This matters because open education research can then seem like something that is not relevant or too onerous.</description>

I have something that seems to work and so thought I would share what I did as a first attempt.</description>

      <description>With my colleagues Emily Bovee (who had the idea for the project and is the first author) and John Ranellucci, I worked on a conference proposal for a conference that provided either a Word Document template or a LaTeX class. Since I had just used (that’s a generous way to put it - I really had struggled through it) LaTeX, I proposed that we see whether we could (continue to) use R and R Markdown, which we used to analyze the data, to prepare the manuscript.</description>

      <description>Social network is increasingly common in education (Sweet, 2016). Very often, social network analysis is used to create sociograms, or depictions of a network. I did this in a paper I recently co-authored (here is a pre-print), we worked hard to create this figure:

Such figures (we thought–and I think) look nice and they are often useful for understanding the characteristics of a network and the relations that are part of it.</description>

      <guid>/blog/in-what-months-are-educational-psychology-jobs-posted-an-update/</guid>
      <description>In August of last year, I wrote a post that involved looking at when educational psychology jobs (mostly, but not only, academic jobs or those related to research and teaching) were posted to the excellent Ed Psych Jobs website. As that post made (in part) the (anticipated) point that most jobs were posted in September (in which 16% of jobs were posted there) and October (14%) (followed by August, with 11%), I thought that it may be helpful to see how accurate that was over the past year.</description>

      <description>Last summer, I taught the MAET Year 2 Summer Cohort with Danah Henriksen. After teaching the class, Danah realized she had taught five cohorts of (awesome) students and that we had some information available from pre- and post-course self-reported surveys to understand how students grew in terms of their confidence in using different educational (and other) technologies.
That research idea evolved into a study with Rohit Mehta that involved, among other findings, a visualization of average pre-post values for specific technologies.</description>

As part of this position, I&amp;rsquo;ll teach science teaching methods (and science and STEM education research-related) courses. Hearing about the first course I&amp;rsquo;ll teach sparked me to gather these.
So, this is a loosely-organized collection of some resources&amp;ndash;especially some new(er) books and National Academies Press (NAP) reports&amp;ndash;related to science teaching and learning. I leave &amp;ldquo;oldies but goodies&amp;rdquo;, like Taking Science to School (2007), the Framework for K-12 Science Education (2012), and America&amp;rsquo;s Lab Report (2006) for example.</description>

      <description>This post includes a few things about getting started bike commuting. The thesis is something like: If you have a bike and a safe route, you can probably commute right away, and then add-on other things (like a rack, fenders, or different tires) over time.
The most important thing - a safe route! The most important thing is a safe route! In my experience, roads with bike lanes, or&amp;ndash;even better&amp;ndash;greenways (for runners, walkers, and bikers) are best, followed by neighborhood roads, followed by city roads with street parking.</description>

Introduction I’ve been interested in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for a little while, in part because of a paper by Tom Houslay and Alastair Wilson (2017) that shows how using output from models the way I have been can lead to results that overstate the impact of effects.</description>

      <description>Outside of education, one of my interests is cycling, and one of my favorite ways to cycle is on rail-trails, pathways and greenways that are converted from former railroad tracks.
In a side-project (and because the data source can be used for teaching and learning about complex, nested data), I collected information from the TrailLink website. I’ve blogged about this data here and here to find out what the best rail-trails in Michigan are and to find out what the characteristics of the best rail-trails are, respectively.</description>

      <description>I’m excited to introduce tidyLPA, an R package for carrying out Latent Profile Analysis (LPA). This is the result of a collaborative project with Jennifer Schmidt, Patrick Beymer, and Rebecca Steingut, and is the result of a long period of learning about cluster analysis (see here) and, recently, model-based cluster analysis. Here, I introduce and describe LPA as a particular type of model-based cluster analysis.
Note: This post has been updated to reflect the latest version of tidyLPA</description>

      <description>As part of a revise and resubmit decision for a paper (that was just accepted to the Journal of Youth and Adolescence (pre-print here)), we (Patrick Beymer, Jennifer Schmidt, and I) were asked by the editor to carry out sensitivity analysis for findings. Our understanding was that, in this context, sensitivity analysis means one of two things - or both:
 How results hold up under different specfications of an analyses How much bias would have to be present to invalidate an inference  Over the past year or so, I had learned about sensitivity analysis from a class and then work with Ken Frank.</description>

      <description>The Scientific Practices project, was focused on engaging middle school students in scientific and engineering practices (such as developing and using models, constructing explanations of phenomena, and analyzing and interpreting data). As part of this longitudinal project, we carried out field experiments to understand the impact of specific features of the curriculum.
In this paper published in the International Journal of Educational Research with Mete Akcaoglu, John Ranellucci, Christina Schwarz, and I examined whether asking students to generate ideas about how what they were learning about could be useful in the future.</description>

Background Research in classrooms and schools can be complex because of all of the factors that matter. A question that often comes up when we say that we observed some pattern in data is, but did you control for X?
In the context of working on an approach to find out how impactful an omitted variable would need to be to invalidate an inference, we had to modify a function that worked for a single sensitivity analysis to work for many and to be easier to use.</description>

      <description>Because of interest and the need for better examples (for teaching and for use in tools under-development), such as prcr and tidyLPA, I worked to create two data packages, data easily available through an R package.
A benefit of the data being in an R package is that it is even easier to access than other formats (in R): Just load the name of the package and type the name of the data frame, or, if the data is included as built-in data in another package (one that is loaded), just type the name of the data frame.</description>

      <description>Through a few different projects and people (such as SIPS and rOpenSci and conversations with friends / colleagues both online and offline), I have been exposed to the idea of open science.
I’m actually going to punt for the moment. Here’s a definition that sounds about right to me:
 Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years, I have worked with Jennifer Schmidt and Patrick Beymer to explore student engagement in science using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). Most recently, we used what scholars have referred to as a “person-in-context” approach, using both ESM and a person-oriented approach.
A figure is helpful for conveying how the person-oriented approach can be used to find common momentary engagement profiles:
We examine how common these profiles are in laboratory activities and on the basis of students’ ability to make choices.</description>

      <description>Between commuting by bicycle and working, I listen to a lot of podcasts. I listen to podcasts to learn something new, keep up with the news, and, occasionally, hear other viewpoints. I thought it would be worth sharing a few that I (almost) never miss downloading and listening to, especially those that others may not regularly hear about, are new, or are sort of niche in terms of the audience.</description>

      <description>Note that due to version-related issues the code in this post is displayed but is not excecuted/run.
According to the MPlus website, the R package MPlusAutomation serves three purposes:
Creating related groups of models Running batches Extracting and tabulating model parameters and test statistics.  Because modeling involves comparing related models, (partially) automating these is compelling. It can make it easier to use model results in subsequent analyses and can cut down on copy and pasting output or results between programs.</description>

      <guid>/blog/comparing-mixed-effects-and-linear-models/</guid>
      <description>Some background One reason to use mixed effects models is that they help to account for data with a complex structure, such as multiple responses (to questions, for example) from the same people, students grouped into classes, and measures collected over time. Often, the way they account for these complex structures is in terms of reducing their bias, which has to do with when a model comes up with an estimate that is off - too large, too small, or maybe too certain (or uncertain) relative to the true value of the thing that is estimated.</description>

      <description>Catching up I wrote a blog post (one that, to be honest, I liked a lot) on what the best rail-trails are in Michigan (here). A friend and colleague at MSU, Andy, noticed that paved trails seemed to be rated higher, and this as well as my cfriend and colleague Kristy’s comment about how we can use the output of the the previous post sparked my curiosity in trying to figure out what characteristics predict how highly (or not highly) rated trails are.</description>

To start, I checked whether they had a way to access the reviews on the site through an API.</description>

      <description>Background How many groups, or types, of Star Wars characters are there? I’ve been wanting to use the starwars dataset built-in to the dplyr package, and at the same time, have been working hard on an R package to carry out an analysis suited to doing this. Part of the challenge of using the approach in this R package is determining how groups groups there are.
Many approaches (Latent Profile Analysis, for example) use Maximum Likelihood estimation (while the approach I’ve developed uses a two-step cluster analysis based around the geometric (and algebraic) idea of “distance”, or how close (similar) observations are).</description>

      <description>Around two years ago, I was fortunate to not have to work in the summer: I had a research fellowship from May - August through the College of Education at MSU.
As a result, I didn’t buy a parking pass for the summer. I still came in to campus, but since I didn’t have any official, regularly-scheduled meetings, I thought I could bike in when I needed to. I had biked to campus before, so I was familiar with the route and where I would park my bike, but I didn’t regularly commute.</description>

      <description>The R package for person-oriented analysis (prcr) is updated (it’s now version 0.1.4).
In particular, it was not clear how to use the profile assignments (i.e., what cluster each response is in) in subsequent analyses. So, the update now returns two different representations of the profile assignments, or which profile is associated with each observation: a) the original “data.frame” with the profile assignment added in one variable and b) the original “data.</description>

      <description>I’m excited to share that prcr (0.1.0), an R package for person-centered analysis, is now available on CRAN via install.packages(&amp;quot;prcr&amp;quot;).
Person-centered analyses focus on clusters, or profiles, of observations, and their change over time or differences across factors.
The package is designed to be “low threshold but high ceiling”, in that you can do all of the analysis with one function, create_profiles(df, n_clusters), where dfis a data.frame of the variables to cluster, and n_clusters is the specified number of clusters.</description>

      <description>Dr. Rosenberg teaches classes in science and STEM education, educational technology, and research methods. In his classes, Dr. Rosenberg aims to involve students in authentic practices from the field of study. For example, in teacher education classes, this plays out through giving students opportunities to both participate in as well as plan and enact activities focused upon engaging in scientific and engineering practices. In graduate-level classes, Dr. Rosenberg focuses on scholarly practices, particularly critiquing and contributing to ongoing conversations about educational policy and practice.</description>
