<h2 id="research-statement">Research Statement</h2>

<p>Data science is commonly characterized as a field that integrates disciplinary expertise, statistics, and advanced computational techniques to answer questions or solve problems.  In education, data science education has potential as a set of ideas and practices that cut across STEM content areas and can also be meaningful to learners, but the potential for data in education has not yet been fully realized. My research focuses on how learners think of and with data, particularly in science education settings. I have pursued this research interest through:
- developing new pedagogical approaches to support students to participate in aspects of data science that are critical but under-emphasized, such as structuring data and combining data from different sources;
- exploring how students engage in foundational aspects of data science, especially recognizing, modeling, and visualizing variability in data;
- and, adapting existing pedagogical approaches and technological tools, such as science simulations, to output complex, quantitative data for students to model.</p>

<p>New approaches to research such as data science allow researchers to study learning in innovative ways, but, most of the time, these approaches are used to make research more efficient or to augment existing approaches, instead of transforming how research is carried out. Following from my interest in how learners think of and with data, my second research interest concerns how researchers can leverage data science-related capabilities and techniques in their own work, especially to study learning in the context in which teaching and learning actually take place. I have pursued this research interest through:
- making use of a novel experience sampling method to understand how students and youth experience learning science in-the-moment and in authentic classroom contexts;
- advancing new research approaches, such as social network analysis to analyze teachersâ€™ conversations on social media;
- and, building the capacity of educational researchers and other education stakeholders through writing about data science and computational social science research methodologies.</p>

<h2 id="ongoing-research-projects">Ongoing Research Projects</h2>

<p>Here is a sample of ongoing research projects.</p>

<p><strong>Planting the Seeds for Computer Science Education</strong></p>

<p>I am presently PI for the University of Tennesee, Knoxville, Community Engaged Research Seed Program-supported project <em>Planting the seeds for computer science education in East Tennessee through a research-practice partnership</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Profiles of Science Engagement</strong></p>

<p>I am presently a consultant for a project with <a href="http://education.msu.edu/search/FormView.aspx?email=jaschmid%40msu.edu">Jennifer Schmidt (Michigan State University)</a> with the following aims:</p>

<ul>
<li>Investigate student engagement through the use of data collected through an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) from a person-in-context-approach.</li>
<li>Use data collected from both middle and high school classes as well as outside-of-school STEM programs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Beginning Teachers Use of Social Media to Seek Out Resources</strong></p>

<p>I am presently a Co-PI for a project with <a href="https://rossier.usc.edu/faculty-and-research/directories/a-z/profile/?id=221">Stephen Aguilar (University of Southern California)</a> with the following aims:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand how beginning mathematics teachers seek out resources when planning lessons using social media such as Twitter, Reddit, and Pinterest</li>
<li>Use a modified ESM approach in which teachers select the days on which they plan to respond to questions sent via text message about any resources they sought out.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Next Generation Science Standards Twitter Chats</strong></p>

<p>I am leading a project focused around analyzing how teachers, researchers, and other stakeholders use the Twitter hashtag #NGSSchat.</p>
