      <description>Background How many groups, or types, of Star Wars characters are there? I’ve been wanting to use the starwars dataset built-in to the dplyr package, and at the same time, have been working hard on an R package to carry out an analysis suited to doing this. Part of the challenge of using the approach in this R package is determining how groups groups there are.
Many approaches (Latent Profile Analysis, for example) use Maximum Likelihood estimation (while the approach I’ve developed uses a two-step cluster analysis based around the geometric (and algebraic) idea of “distance”, or how close (similar) observations are).</description>
