      <description>Around two years ago, I was fortunate to not have to work in the summer: I had a research fellowship from May - August through the College of Education at MSU.
As a result, I didn’t buy a parking pass for the summer. I still came in to campus, but since I didn’t have any official, regularly-scheduled meetings, I thought I could bike in when I needed to. I had biked to campus before, so I was familiar with the route and where I would park my bike, but I didn’t regularly commute.</description>
