      <description>I have used Wordpress for more than seven years. Over that time, Iâ€™ve used multiple shared servers, and have had a myriad of domain names.

I started to look for a new hosting company, and slowly started to coalesce around the idea of, well, not having one, and using GitHub Pages instead.</description>
