# Research Interests

*Joshua M. Rosenberg (PhD, Michigan State University) is an Assistant Professor of STEM Education at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His research focuses on how learners think of and with data, particularly in science education settings. Dr. Rosenberg tries to understand how practices such as creating, representing, and modeling data create new opportunities for learning how to use data to pose and answer questions about scientific phenomena.*

*Dr. Rosenberg is also interested in student engagement across a range of STEM learning environments and the use of technology in education, particularly for teacher professional development. As a part of this work, Dr. Rosenberg makes use of quantitative methods, such as multi-level models for analyzing data collected through the experience sampling method, and newer approaches, such as social network analysis to analyze teachers’ conversations on social media. Dr. Rosenberg’s research has been published in journals such as the Journal of Research on Science Teaching, the Journal of Youth and Adolescence and the Journal of Technology and Teacher Education.*

## Ongoing Research Projects

Here is a sample of ongoing research projects. 

**Planting the Seeds for Computer Science Education**

I am presently PI for the University of Tennesee, Knoxville, Community Engaged Research Seed Program-supported project *Planting the seeds for computer science education in East Tennessee through a research-practice partnership*.

**Profiles of Science Engagement**

I am presently a consultant for a project with [Jennifer Schmidt (Michigan State University)](http://education.msu.edu/search/FormView.aspx?email=jaschmid%40msu.edu) with the following aims:

* Investigate student engagement through the use of data collected through an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) from a person-in-context-approach.
* Use data collected from both middle and high school classes as well as outside-of-school STEM programs.

**Beginning Teachers Use of Social Media to Seek Out Resources**

I am presently a Co-PI for a project with [Stephen Aguilar (University of Southern California)](https://rossier.usc.edu/faculty-and-research/directories/a-z/profile/?id=221) with the following aims:

* Understand how beginning mathematics teachers seek out resources when planning lessons using social media such as Twitter, Reddit, and Pinterest
* Use a modified ESM approach in which teachers select the days on which they plan to respond to questions sent via text message about any resources they sought out.

**Next Generation Science Standards Twitter Chats**

I am leading a project focused around analyzing how teachers, researchers, and other stakeholders use the Twitter hashtag #NGSSchat.
