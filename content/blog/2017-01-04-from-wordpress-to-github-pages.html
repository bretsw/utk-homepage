<p>I have used <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> for more than seven years. Over that time, Iâ€™ve used multiple shared servers, and have had a myriad of domain names.</p>
<p>Most recently, my shared server at Lansing, MI-based <a href="https://www.liquidweb.com/">Liquid Web</a> ended, due to Liquid Web leaving the shared hosting business to focus only on dedicated and virtual private servers.</p>
<p>I started to look for a new hosting company, and slowly started to coalesce around the idea of, well, not having one, and using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> instead.</p>
<p>I already have a number of files on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/jrosen48">here</a>) and especially like the simplicity of it - and the ability to write in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, not HTML.</p>
<p>So that is what I am doing.</p>
