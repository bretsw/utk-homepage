I'm super excited to share that I will be writing a book, *Data Science in Education Using R*. The book will be published by [Routledge](https://www.routledge.com) sometime in mid-to-late 2020, and, importantly to us, Routledge agreed to let us keep the copyright for a web-version of the book, meaning that we will publish the entire contents of the book in an open and freely-available format (along with the print and e-book versions, which will be available for sale). This project has been a bit of a labor of love and so it is very rewarding to be able to (finally) announce that the book will be published.

The book will be published with an amazing group of co-authors ([Emily Bovee](https://www.emilybovee.com/), [Ryan Estrellado](https://ryanestrellado.netlify.com/), [Jesse Motsipak](https://www.jessemaegan.com/), me (I'll leave it to you to decide about *this* co-author), and [Isabella VelaÃÅsquez](https://ivelasq.rbind.io). In a way, the ais of the book are ambitous: can we speak to data science in/across all of education? I think so, as I know we have the folks we would need to try to do this. We will 

In addition to a strong team of co-authors, this work was supported by many individuals it the [Data Edu Slack channel](https://dataedu.slack.com/) in which this book took form. On behalf of my co-authors, thank you to everyone who contributed code, suggested changes, asked questions and filed issues, and even designed a logo for us: Abi Aryan, Jason Becker, William Bork, Erin Grande, Jake Kaupp, Ludmila Janda, Kris Stevens, David Ranzolin, and Bret Staudt Willet.

A repository for the book, which will soon include a link to the in-development book, is available here on [GitHub](https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education).
