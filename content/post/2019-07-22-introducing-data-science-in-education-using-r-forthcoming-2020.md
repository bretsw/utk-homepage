## Data Science in Education Using R

I'm super excited to share that I will be writing a book, *Data Science in Education Using R*. The book will be published by [Routledge](https://www.routledge.com) sometime in mid-to-late 2020, and, importantly to us, Routledge agreed to let us keep the copyright for a web-version of the book, meaning that we will publish the entire contents of the book in an open and freely-available format (along with the print and e-book versions, which will be available for sale). The project has been a bit of a labor of love and so it is very rewarding to be able to (finally) announce that the book will be published.

The book will be published with an amazing group of co-authors: [Emily Bovee](https://www.emilybovee.com/), [Ryan Estrellado](https://ryanestrellado.netlify.com/), [Jesse Motstipak](https://www.jessemaegan.com/), me, and [Isabella VelaÃÅsquez](https://ivelasq.rbind.io). While the aims of the book may be ambitious (trying to speak to the role of data science across education roles), I know we have the right people (I'll leave it to you to decide about *this* co-author) to do it.

## Some Thanks

We started writing this book in the open, on GitHub (see the link at the bottom), and, as a result, this work was supported by many individuals it the [Data Edu Slack channel](https://dataedu.slack.com/) in which this book took form. On behalf of my co-authors, thank you to everyone who contributed code, suggested changes, asked questions and filed issues, and even designed a logo for us: [Abi Aryan](http://www.abiaryan.com/), [Jason Becker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsonbecker/), [William Bork](http://www.williambork.com/), [Erin Grande](http://eringrand.github.io/), [Jake Kaupp](http://www.jakekaupp.com/), [Ludmila Janda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludmila-janda-866259119/), [Kris Stevens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristopherdelanestevens/), [David Ranzolin](https://github.com/daranzolin), and [Bret Staudt Willet](http://bretsw.com/). Thank you, too, to [Enilda Romero-Hall](https://www.enildaromero.net/) and [Mark Warschauer](http://education.uci.edu/markw-bio.html) for sharing valuable advice on the book publishing process, as well as to folks on social media who have shared their excitement as well as writing tips with us. Finally, thanks to Hannah Shakespeare, our editor at Routledge, for interest in this work and for pursuing and eventually supporting us to publish a web-based version of the book.

## Following the Book's Development

A repository for the book (which will soon include a link to the in-development book) is available here on [GitHub](https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education), and will be updated as we write the book. You can also reach out to any of the authors if you have questions, wish to provide feedback, or, even, if you just want to talk more about data science in education.
