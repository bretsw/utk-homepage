<p>I’m just beginning to learn BibTeX, which is, according to Wikipedia <span class="citation">(2020)</span>, “reference management software for formatting lists of references”.</p>
<p>It is useful for publishing formats such as R Markdown documents and books created with bookdown, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX">Data Science in Education Using R</a> book.</p>
<p>I’m basically using this post to documenti what I’m learning.</p>
<div id="references" class="section level2">
<h2>References</h2>
<p>I started with references, which are saved in plain text documents ending in <code>.bib</code>. So that R Markdown knows the file(s) to use, the filename is added to the front matter of the document. In R Markdown, for example, I can use the plain text file <code>references.bib</code>, im which I store references, by adding this line to the YAML front matter{</p>
<p><code>bibliography: [references.bib]</code></p>
<p>References have a format which is a bit intuitive. Here is an example for our book:</p>
<pre class="code"><code>@book{dsieur-under-contract,
  author = {Emily A. Bovee and Ryan A. Estrellado and Jesse Mostipak and Joshua M. Rosenberg and Isabella C. Velásquez},
  title = {Data science in education using R},
  year = {under contract},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  url = {https://datascienceineducation.com},
 }</code></pre>
<p>The key parts are the <code>@book</code> (which can be replaced with <code>@article</code>, <code>@proceedings</code>, <a href="http://bib-it.sourceforge.net/help/fieldsAndEntryTypes.php#Entries">.etc</a>), the “key” (which, for us, is <code>dsieur-under-contract</code>), and the key-value pairs. In addition to those used above (for author, title, year, publisher, and url, <a href="http://bib-it.sourceforge.net/help/fieldsAndEntryTypes.php#Fields">others</a> are available, including volume, issue, chapter, and editor).</p>
</div>
<div id="citations" class="section level2">
<h2>Citations</h2>
<p>With a reference saved in the <code>.bib</code> file (and the <code>.bib</code> file referenced in the document or book front matter), it can be cited in text by referring to the citation key. For example, the following sentence:</p>
<pre class="code"><code>An aim of *Data science in education using R* is to help to equip those working in education, including teachers, data analysts and scientists, researchers, and administrators to solve problems and ask questions in the context of educational data and systems [@dsieur-under-contract.]</code></pre>
<p>(Oye, I’ll leave it to my co-authors to summarize the aims of our book better.)</p>
<p>Would render as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An aim of <em>Data science in education using R</em> is to help to equip those working
in education, including teachers, data analysts and scientists, researchers, and
administrators to solve problems and ask questions in the context of educational
data and systems <span class="citation">(Bovee et al., n.d.)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>References can be cited in different way.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[@dsieur-under-contract]</code> renders as <span class="citation">(Bovee et al., n.d.)</span> for parenthetical citations</li>
<li><code>@dsieur-under-contract</code> renders as <span class="citation">Bovee et al. (n.d.)</span> for in-text citations</li>
<li><code>-@dsieur-under-contract</code> renders as <span class="citation">(n.d.)</span> for only the year</li>
</ul>
