Since this past summer, I've tried to moderate my use of social media. I've 
tried a number of strategies (like limiting the amount of time I spend each day),
but none have been very effective, apart from a fairly dramatic step, 
deactivating my accounts, which was (until I got back on). While my accounts 
were deactivated, I missed keeping up with and being in touch with friends and 
family, but I found other ways to communciate (I actually had two phone calls!).

Social media is immensely powerful. I met (all but one of) the co-authors of the
data science-related book I am writing through Twitter. I entered by graduate 
program at Michigan State through a (now) mentor I was introduced to on Twitter. 
These are just a few examples.

Some, I know, are better about moderating their use, but I'm not. I don't have 
anything profound to say; I just can't seem to use social media moderately. So, 
I'm going to take a longer break from social media. I know there are folks who 
I will want to stay in touch with; I'll be sure to stay in touch (but reach out 
via text, or email, carrier pigeon, or some other messaging service or means).
