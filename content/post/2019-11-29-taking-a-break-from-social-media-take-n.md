Since this past summer, I've tried to moderate my use of social media. I've 
tried a number of strategies (like limiting the amount of time I spend each day),
but none have been very effective, apart from a fairly dramatic step, which was 
effective: deactivating my accounts. When I did, I missed keeping up with and 
being in touch with friends and family, but I found other ways to communciate.

Some, I know, are better about moderating their use, but I'm not. So, I'm going
to take a longer break from social media. I know there are folks who I will 
want to stay in touch with; I'll be sure to stay in touch (but reach out via
text, or email, or some other messaging service or means!).
