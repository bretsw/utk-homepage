In many classes I teach, I assign students to *base groups*, groups of around three or four students who sit together (for most of the time) and "check-in" and "check-out" of class. The goal of base groups is to foster a kind of [positive interdependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_interdependence) among students. 

The check out questions are typically the same:

- What is one thing you learned today?
- What is one thing you want to learn more about?

The check-in questions typically consist of one that is somewhat general (and not necessarily related to the focus of the previous or present class - or to the class, at all!), whereas the second question is typically related to the recent focus of the class. I thought it would be helpful to collate some of the first check-in questions for future reference (and perhaps for others' reference). Here are some that I have used:

- What is something that you’re good at but you don’t like to do?
- What is something that you like to do that you’re not good at?
-
