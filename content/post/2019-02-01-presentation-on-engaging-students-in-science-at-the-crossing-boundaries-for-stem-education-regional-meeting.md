I had the opportunity to present on *Engaging students in science: Findings from an experience sampling method approach* at the [East TN STEM Hub](https://ceems.utk.edu/) 'Crossing Boundaries for STEM Education' regional meeting and mini-conference. 

My presentation was hosted [here](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/east-tn-stem.html#1). 

A big thank you to Dr. Lynn Hodge, Dr. Anne Ho, Nick Kim, and Shande King for organizing this event. It was a great event; also, it reminded me of one of my favorite events at Michigan State University, the [Create for STEM](https://create4stem.msu.edu/) mini-conference.

Also, thank you to Dr. Ho for taking this picture!
