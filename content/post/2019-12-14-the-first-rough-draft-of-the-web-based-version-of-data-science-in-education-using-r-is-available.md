The first, rough draft of the (web-based version) of the *Data Science in Education Using R* book (by Emily Bovee, Ryan Estrellado, Jesse Motstipak, me, and Isabella VelaÃÅsquez) is available from this URL: http://www.datascienceineducation.com/

I mentioned in [an earlier post](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/posts/introducing-data-science-in-education-using-r-forthcoming-2020/) that the published, Routledge, allowed us to stipulate that we retain the copyright for the web-based version, even after the book is published in print (and e-book) format.

This is definitely a first, rough draft (this will be particularly in the context of some of the network plots, which rendered in a ridiculous- and incorect-manner [see [here](https://www.datascienceineducation.com/walkthrough-sna.html#plotting-the-network)]), and this is a bug *and* a feature. You can provide feedback on any part of the book in the GitHub repository for it ([here](https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education) or by reaching out to any of us. We expect for the book to be published sometime in the next year.
