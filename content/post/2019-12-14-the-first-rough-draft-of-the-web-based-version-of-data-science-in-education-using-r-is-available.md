The first, rough draft of the (web-based version) of the *Data Science in Education Using R* book (by Emily Bovee, Ryan Estrellado, Jesse Motstipak, me, and Isabella VelaÃÅsquez) is available from this URL: http://www.datascienceineducation.com/

I mentioned in [an earlier post](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/posts/introducing-data-science-in-education-using-r-forthcoming-2020/) that the published, Routledge, allowed us to stipulate that we retain the copyright for the web-based version, even after the book is published in print (and e-book) format.

This is definitely a first, rough (rough!) draft (this will be particularly in the context of some of the network plots, which rendered in a ridiculous- and incorect-manner [see [here](https://www.datascienceineducation.com/walkthrough-sna.html#plotting-the-network)]), and we (like other authors who have written books in the open from which we drew inspiration, such as *Advanced R*: https://adv-r.hadley.nz/introduction.html#intro-ack) think this is both a bug *and* a feature. You can provide feedback on any part of the book in the GitHub repository for it ([here](https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education) or by reaching out to any of us. 

While we expect most of the structure of the book to change (i.e., the topics of each chapter and their order), we are actively revising, adding to, and cutting the content, and will add at least some new content prior to the final version. We expect for the book to be published sometime in the next year.
