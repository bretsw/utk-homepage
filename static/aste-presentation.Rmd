# Background

---

# The Next Generation Science Standards

- NGSS (or NGSS-inspired) standards in 39 states (National Science Teachers Association, 2018)
- Catalyzed by a series of reports (National Research Council, 2007, 2012)
- While reform efforts in science education are *not* new (DeBoer, 2014), the new reforms have some cause to be thought of as different

---

# Is this time different?

- More **discussion** between practitioners and researchers than before (i.e., RPPs; Coburn & Penuel, 2016)
  - Including in science education (Loucks-Horsely, Stiles, Mundry, Love, & Hewson, 2010; Luft & Hewson, 2014)
- Increased prominence (ubiquity?) of digital **technologies** in teacher professional development (e.g., Reiser et al., 2017)
- Greater recognition of **informal learning** through networks (i.e., PLNs; Trust, 2012)

---

# Teacher learning

- Teacher learning can occur anywhere (Desimone & Garet, 2015)
    - Involvement is often limited by barriers especially geographic ones
- One way to break out of these boundarie: conceptualize professional learning as *participation in online and communities and networks* (i.e., Siemens, 2014)
    - Can lead to more heterogeneous learning communities (Luft & Hewson, 2014)

???

Should align with current science standards, practices, and content that teachers will encounter (i.e., coherency and content focus); afford teachers opportunities to actively and collaboratively construct appropriate requisite knowledge (i.e., active engagement and collaboration); and foster lifelong learning mindsets within teachers
Effective teacher professional development and learning is facilitated through interactions with other stakeholders that provide opportunities to foster discussions about research and practice (Borko, Jacobs, & Koellner, 2010; Darling-Hammond, Hyler, & Gardner, 2017; Luft & Hewson, 2014)

# Teacher Learning Through Twitter (Part 1)

- Some teachers' PLNs include Twitter communities (Lord & Lomicka, 2014; Rehm & Notten, 2016)
- Twitter has been used (in education) for many differerent purposes (Greenhalgh & Koehler, 2017; Greenhalgh, Rosenberg, Wolf, & Koehler, 2016; Krutka, Asino, & Haselwood, 2018; Romero-Hall, 2017)
- Has affordances and some constraints for professional learning
    - Its informal, *just for me* approach to learning is in contrast to common *one-size fits all* perspective of traditional professional development
    - Or, is it too unstructured or not disconnected from teachers' professional practice (Torphy & Frank, in preparation)

# Teacher Learning Through Twitter (Part 2)

- Some past research has focused on a convention designed to make the *firehose* of information more manageable, a focus on hashtags
- A hashtag is a convention on Twitter that is used to organize conversations, and, allows for regularly occurring (or synchronous) chats at pre-specified times (e.g., Rosenberg, Akcaoglu, Staudt Willet, Greenhalgh, & Koehler, 2017).

---

# What is the role of #NGSSchat Regarding Teacher Learning Through Twitter?

- Twitter and #NGSSchat are *potentially* valuable to science educators
- Chats organized through hashtags are possibly somewhat distinct (Rosenberg, Akcaoglu, Staudt Willet, Greenhalgh, & Koehler, 2017)
  - May be one of the largest, and perhaps important, networks for science educators
  - Can be a place for teachers to interact with other teachers and with other science education stakeholders
    - Important because doing so can shape how teachers engage in sensemaking (Coburn, 2001)


---

# Need for study

- Unlike many formal opportunities and PLNs, this informal (yet growing and inclusive of a myriad of educators and researchers) platform has not yet been the focus of any studies
  - One excellent *NSTA Reports* article by Shelton and Ende (2015)
- Repeated calls for more empirical research on the effectiveness of online teacher education opportunities (Borko, Jacobs, & Koellner, 2010; Fishman, Konstantopoulos, Kubitskey, Vath, Park, Johnson, & Edelson; Moon, Passmore, Reiser, & Michaels, 2014)

???
Articulates learning as a process enacted through networks and communities, and these communities are enhanced through technological mediums (Siemens, 2005) such as #NGSSchat

---

# Framing and Research Questions

- Within web-based communities like #NGSSchat, participants may be a part of a dynamic, cultural community (Guti√©rrez and Rogoff)
- We used connectivism (Siemens, 2013) and social network theory (Carolan, 2014) to frame the study

1. Which groups of individuals are the most central?
2. Which groups of individuals have received and sent interactions?
3. What explains who individuals have chosen to interact with?

# Method

---

# Research Approach

- Social Network Analysis (SNA)
   - Conventionally offline *and also* online and using digital traces (Spillane, Kim, & Frank, 2012)
   - Augmented offline with information from digital traces (e.g., McFarland, Lewis, & Goldberg, 2015)
      - In this latter tradition, we employed SNA to describe and examine #NGSSchat

# Data Sources

- Novel data source: Tweets that were archived in the #NGSSchat community between 2012 and 2017 on *Storify*
- Tweets come from "chats," the synchronous periods of time during which #NGSSchat users arranged to meet to discuss pre-arranged topics
    - In total, collected data from 103 chats

  - 34,668 favorites (*endorsing* network)
  - 13,498 replies (*conversing* network)
  - 10,382 mentions (*conversing* network)
  - 8,912 retweets (*endorsing* network)
  - 1,899 quotes (*endorsing* network)

# Discussion

---

# Key Findings

- NGSSchat is used by a wide array of individuals
- Many interactions between many individuals (from different groups)
  - Based upon descriptions of *other* PLNs (e.g., Trust, 2012), this seems like a potential candidate
- Has characterstics in-line with other communities, such as state-based networks (Rosenberg et al., 2016)

---

# Key Findings

- Researchers are popular in terms of being the recipient of conversing and endorsing ties
- Teachers, on the other hand, were more likely to send conversing ties
- In all, individuals‚Äîand teachers in particular‚Äîwho participate in the hashtag can expect to be popular

---

# Limitations: The Nature of This Kind of Study

- Use of a large data set from a social media we source 
- Data from over five years, with more than 500 individuals and 60,000 observed interactions
- But, this is also, in other ways, a very limited data set
- Partial example of the new research methods that can be termed *computational social science* (Salganik, 2017; Lazer et al., 2009)
- There are also other ways we could use the data we have (DeLaat & Schreurs, 2013)

???

- While we have rich information about the interactions we observed, these were four specific interactions made possible through Twitter - and what we can say about relations is necessarily limited. 
- Such methods have many strengths, such as being able to study groups of individuals who may not otherwise be studied or to do so in ways that would not be feasible, such as examining interactions from such a diverse group of individuals‚Äîfrom beginning teachers to superintendents‚Äîas in the present study
- Nevertheless, questions such as how representative our sample was, and how much we can know about participants beyond their profession/role, limit the present study. They also suggest future directions that involve collecting survey data from participants (separately or perhaps in conjunction with data from social media). 
	Another limitation of this study comes out of the assumptions that are made when using social network analysis (Wasserman & Faust, 1994)
  - Described three ways of studying learning in networks: surveying about relations (i.e., social network analysis), content analysis of conversations that are occurring, and understanding the reasons behind the specific behaviors and conversations observed in the network (i.e., contextual analysis)

---

# Limitations: Representativeness

- How much we can know about participants beyond their profession/role
- Diversity and inclusivity of NGSSchat is an open question
- Self-reported perceptions of the value of NGSSchat may differ from those evidenced from this data source

---

# Future Directions: Selection

- Interested in who chooses to interact with who
  - Are teachers more likely to interact with researchers (and vice vera)
- Selection models may be helpful:
  - A *p2* model (Van Duijn, Snijders, & Zijlstra, 2004)
  - Exponential random graph model (Hunter, Handcock, Butts, Goodreau, & Morris, 2008)

# Future Directions: Topics Discussed

- Future work can explore topics discussed in the networks
  - Preliminary analyses suggest that topic discussed ranged from those common to conversations about science teaching and learning as well as those related to the NGSS
- Can analyze what is discussed when different groups interact (e.g., Miranda, Kim, and Summers, 2015).

---

# Implications for practice

- Usefulness of Twitter for fostering relationships that center on current science education ideas
- Social media can be important to science educators concerning their professional development and learning
- Can be important to teacher educators and teacher education (Carpenter, 2018)
- This type of communication aligns with recommendations for teacher professional development (Desimone & Garet, 2001)
- Social media connect individuals who may not connect otherwise (Gunawardena, Hermans, Sanchez, Richmond, Bohley, & Tuttle, 2009)

???
, such as, aligning to national and state standards (NGSS), focusing on content (science), and supporting a collaborative learning environment
---

# Possible implications for #NGSSchat stakeholders

- Emphasize interactions between participants
- Consider #NGSSchat to be a site for potential future research
- Explore other settings based upon where stakeholders already are
